The [demo](http://community-currency.meteor.com) is powered by [materialize css](http://materializecss.com) and [Meteor JS](http://www.meteor.com)

This demo allows users to instantly transfer any arbitrary value to another member in seconds. Banks can take days to transfer money to an individual, and while credit card payments are very fast, they come with extra charges and hidden costs. This pilot project demonstrates how fast and easy direct payment could be.

If you'd like to try the demo, go to [community-currency.meteor.com](http://community-currency.meteor.com),and sign up with Facebook or your email address. You can then send any amount to another user. To begin, try sending something to the test user <strong>dummy</strong></p>

Many great UI features could be added to the demo, and I hope other developers will fork the project and implement some of those potential improvements. I'd love to hear your feedback and suggestions here or on Twitter @SeanPWStanley.
